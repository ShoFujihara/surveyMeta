\title{Extract key sections from survey document text}
\usage{
extract_key_sections(text, max_tokens = 60000L, context_chars = 2000L)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{Character. Full document text.}

\item{max_tokens}{Integer. Target token count for extracted sections.}

\item{context_chars}{Integer. Characters to include around each keyword match.}
}
\value{
Character string of extracted sections, with page markers preserved.
}
\description{
When a document is too large for the token budget, this function extracts
the most relevant sections using heading patterns and keyword proximity.
This is NOT RAG; it is a rule-based pre-filter that preserves the
"read the whole document" philosophy for the selected sections.
